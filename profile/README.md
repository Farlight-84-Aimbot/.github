## **Why Farlight 84 Aimbot Beats Other Games’ Versions**

Unlike basic FPS aimbots that just aim in a straight line, the **Farlight 84 aimbot** is built for chaotic, vertical, and high-speed gameplay. Jetpacks, vehicles, and weird weapon recoil patterns don’t break its aim tracking.

In games like Apex Legends or PUBG, aimbots often struggle with vertical movement or fast dodging. Farlight 84’s aimbot adapts, predicting where the enemy will be instead of where they were. That means more hits, fewer wasted shots, and way more wins.
